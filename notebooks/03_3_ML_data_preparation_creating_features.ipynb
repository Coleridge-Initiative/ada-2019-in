    "## Creating Features\n",
    "\n",
    "Our features are our independent variables or predictors. Good features make machine learning systems effective. \n",
    "The better the features the easier it is the capture the structure of the data. You generate features using domain knowledge. In general, it is better to have more complex features and a simpler model rather than vice versa. Keeping the model simple makes it faster to train and easier to understand rather then extensively searching for the \"right\" model and \"right\" set of parameters. \n",
    "\n",
    "Machine Learning Algorithms learn a solution to a problem from sample data. The set of features is the best representation of the sample data to learn a solution to a problem. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Feature engineering** is the process of transforming raw data into features that better represent the underlying problem/data/structure  to the predictive models, resulting in improved model accuracy on unseen data.\" ( from [Discover Feature Engineering](http://machinelearningmastery.com/discover-feature-engineering-how-to-engineer-features-and-how-to-get-good-at-it/) ).  In text, for example, this might involve deriving traits of the text like word counts, verb counts, or topics to feed into a model rather than simply giving it the raw text.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example of feature engineering are: \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Transformations**, such a log, square, and square root.\n",
    "- **Dummy (binary) variables**, also known as *indicator variables*, often done by taking categorical variables\n",
    "(such as city) which do not have a numerical value, and adding them to models as a binary value.\n",
    "- **Discretization**. Several methods require features to be discrete instead of continuous. This is often done \n",
    "by binning, which you can do by various approaches like equal width, deciles, Fisher-Jenks, etc. \n",
    "- **Aggregation.** Aggregate features often constitute the majority of features for a given problem. These use \n",
    "different aggregation functions (*count, min, max, average, standard deviation, etc.*) which summarize several\n",
    "values into one feature, aggregating over varying windows of time and space. For example, for policing or criminal justice problems, we may want to calculate the *number* (and *min, max, mean, variance*, etc.) of crimes within an *m*-mile radius of an address in the past *t* months for varying values of *m* and *t*, and then use all of them as features."
